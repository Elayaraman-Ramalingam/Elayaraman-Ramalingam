		<u><h2> About Me </h2></u>
		<p>
			I'm just a nobody coming from a remote village called <i>Ranganoor</i> situated in Salem District. I have finished my <b>SSLC</b> near my village.
			I used to be a joke for everyone.
			My mother admitted me in a school in salem urban area for higher secondary But it didn't go well.So I have to 
			<u>discontinue my studies</u> and I did that.Then I joined a polytechnic college to pursue diploma engineering.
		</p>

		<u><h2> Education </h2></u>

		<p>
			I have finished my Diploma in computer engineering and I have also worked in my college
			as lab assistant while pursuing my diploma.. I have some job offers in some production companies, But luckily
			I got selected in <b>FSSA</b>.
		</p>

		<u><h2> My Dream </h2></u>

		<p>
			In my childhood days I don't have any dreams about my life , Because I thought I'm not a worthy person to have
			a dream. I have zero confidence on me till my college 2nd year. after I learned about computers and I loved that. <br>
			You can't explain the feeling when do work that you loved the most. It'll give so much confidence on me that I too have skill.
			Now I realised dreams and responsibilities will push ourselves towards the next stage of life.
		</p>

		<u><h2> My Hobbies </h2></u>

		<p>
			I love playing Minecraft and Clash of Clans. I never played any outdoor games Because I don't have many friends play that.o 
			Most impoertantly no one wants to be my friend. Then I learned new things through television and now internet.
			I can repair a PC with small malfunctions and I know networking basics. These things makes me so happy.
		</p>

		<u><h2> My Plan </h2></u>

		<p>
			I promised myself a thing <i>"I'm the person who going to change the view of people on computers"</i>.
			But I'm not going to chase that blindly.First of all I'll stable me and my family financially.
			Then I'll pursue that dream without any hesitations.
